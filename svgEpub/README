What is svgEpub?
 * It generates epub file contains svg data from image files.
 
 Pros:
  - For no flickering page turn on PRS-T2.
  - Even if you enlarge  the page, characters will be displayed finely. 

 Cons:
  - It takes time for conversion. 


Usage:

 2. Checked image files (jpeg, png, gif) will be converted into svg files.
 3. Push Create Epub button.
 4. Select path to save epub.
    Set title and author.
    Input filename of epub.
 5. Push save button.
 6. Please wait for a while. 

Prebuild binary:
 binary/svgEpub.jar (for win64) 


Limitation:
 * It works on windows x64 environment only.
 * No parameter option for conversion of svg.
 * No progress dialog while saving.
 * Page progression direction is rtl. (Right to Left)
 * etc...


Wish list: (Someone may implement them. :)
 * The function to distinguish a sentence from an illustration automatically.
 * The function of generating PDF.
